Privacy Policy Guidance
The Policies for Actions on Google require all Actions to post a link to their privacy policy in the Directory. This guide explains Google's minimum expectations of what your privacy policy should include. It doesn't, however, address all possible use cases or issues. Your privacy policy, along with any in-Action disclosures, should comprehensively and accurately disclose all of your privacy practices. Your Action and privacy policy must also comply with all applicable laws and regulations, so you may need to include additional or different information based on the laws and regulations applicable to you or your Action.
